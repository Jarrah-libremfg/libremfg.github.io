Overview of OpenIDConnect Open ID Connect is a security architecture that uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to access secured resources. JWT are issued by KeyCloak, and the users can be managed in KeyCloak, or managed in other services like LDAP, Google, Azure AD, Facebook, etc.
When a user accesses the user interface, the UI redirects to Keycloak, which depending on how it is configured, will redirect to the authentication provider so that the user can log in.</description></item><item><title>Back up</title><link>/how-to/backup/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 19:35:35 +1100</pubDate><guid>/how-to/backup/</guid><description>Follow this procedure to back up your configuration and data.</description></item><item><title>Stream Data</title><link>/how-to/stream/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/how-to/stream/</guid><description>Stream data in and out of Rhize.
Publishing Changes with Change-Data-Capture You can use change data capture (CDC) to track data changes over time; including mutations and drops in your database. RHIZE&amp;rsquo;s CDC implementation lets you use Kafka, Nats or a local file as a sink to store CDC updates streamed by RHIZE&amp;rsquo;s Alpha leader nodes.
When CDC is enabled, RHIZE streams events for all set and delete mutations, except those that affect password fields; along with any drop events.</description></item></channel></rss>
