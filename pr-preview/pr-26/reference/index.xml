As the communication bridge between the Rhize Data Hub and your plant, the agent can handle reads and writes to and from data sources, and it can be called by a BPMN task.
It works by connecting to equipment or groups of equipment that run over protocols such as OPC UA, and then reading and writing tags to re-publish them to NATS.</description></item><item><title>Glossary</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/glossary/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 19:35:35 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/glossary/</guid><description>The manufacturing industry has many specialized termsâ€”and many abbreviations.
