These sections document all the objects that you can add through the UI, and the fields and properties that you can associate with them. All these models are based on the ISA-95 standard, mostly from Part 2, which describes the role-based equipment hierarchy.
Global object fields All objects that you define must have a unique name.</description></item><item><title>Agent configuration</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/agent-configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/agent-configuration/</guid><description>The Rhize agent collects data that is emitted in the manufacturing process and makes this data visible in the Rhize system. It works by connecting to equipment or groups of equipment that run over protocols such as OPC UA.
As the communication bridge between the Rhize Data Hub and your plant, the agent has multiple functions:
It subscribes to tags and republishes the changes in NATS. It creates an interface for the BPMN engine to send reads and writes to a data source and its associated equipment.</description></item><item><title>NATS configuration</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/nats-config/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 10:22:15 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/nats-config/</guid><description>Rhize uses the NATS message broker for its publish-subscribe messaging. Through NATS, Rhize can decouple services, exchange messages in real-time, and receive event data from all levels of the operation.
These sections describe NATS parameters that are particularly relevant to Rhize&amp;rsquo;s configuration. For general use, refer to the NATS official documentation.
Reserved topics Topics that begin with a dollar sign ($) denote topics specifically about the NATS system.
Jet stream ($JS) The $JS topic is reserved for messages about the NATS JetStream.</description></item><item><title>BMPN elements</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/how-to/bpmn/bpmn-elements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 11:10:37 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/how-to/bpmn/bpmn-elements/</guid><description>These pages describe the elements to make a Rhize BPMN workflow, and their parameters to set conditions, use variables, and call services.
Rhize BPMN elements are based on the Business Process Model and Notation OMG Standard. While the visual grammar is functionally the same, we extend some elements for specific Rhize features, like service tasks that call the GraphQL API.
Each BPMN workflow is a process with an ID. Each process is made up events (circles), activities (rectangles), gateways (diamonds), and flows (arrows).</description></item><item><title>Default local ports</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/default-ports/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 16:49:42 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/default-ports/</guid><description>After you install Rhize services, they are accessible, by default, on the following ports:

This glossary is a reference of how Rhize defines terms used in this documentation.
Agent The Rhize agent bridges your plant processes with the Rhize data hub. It collects data that is emitted during the manufacturing process and publishes it to the NATS message broker. Andon A system that alerts manufacturing teams about problems in processes or quality. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) A standardized graphical notation used to represent business processes in an intuitive, visual way Catch event In BPMN, a catch event reacts to a trigger (compared to a throw event, which returns some result).</description></item></channel></rss>
