      <description>Rhize is a real-time, event-driven manufacturing data hub. It unites data analysis, event monitoring, and process execution in one platform. Its interface and architecture is designed to conform to your processes. We assume nothing about what your manufacturing workflows look like.
Rhize has only one strong opinion: all data exchanged must be modeled on the ISA-95 standard. This standards-based schema is how Rhize connects every data event across an entire operation.</description>

      <description>Rhize is a real-time, Event-driven, Manufacturing Data Hub that has built-in Business Process Orchestration.
So what&amp;rsquo;s all that then?
Challenges For manufacturers, digitalization can bring numerous benefits, including increased productivity, improved efficiency, and enhanced decision-making capabilities. However, successful implementation must overcome many challenges:
Legacy Systems and Infrastructure: Many manufacturing facilities have outdated systems and equipment that may not be compatible with digital technologies. Integrating new digital solutions with existing infrastructure can be complex and require significant investments to upgrade or replace outdated systems.</description>

      <guid>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/how-to/query/default/</guid>
      <description>The @default directive provides default values to be stored when not supplied in a mutation (add/update).
Here&amp;rsquo;s the GraphQL definition of the directives:
directive @default(add: DgraphDefault, update: DgraphDefault) on FIELD_DEFINITION input DgraphDefault { value: String } Syntax:
type Type { field: FieldType @default( add: {value: &amp;#34;value&amp;#34;} update: { value: &amp;#34;value&amp;#34;} ) } Where a value is not provided as input for a mutation, the add value will be used if the node is being created, and the update value will be used if the node exists and is being updated.</description>

      <guid>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/concepts/architecture/realtime-database/</guid>
      <description>A real-time database is a type of database system that is designed to handle and process data in real-time or near real-time, meaning that data changes are immediately reflected and accessible to users or applications without any noticeable delay. These databases are commonly used in scenarios where data needs to be continuously updated and retrieved in a highly responsive manner.
Traditional databases, such as relational databases, are optimized for handling transactions and data consistency but may not be as efficient for real-time applications.</description>

      <guid>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/concepts/architecture/data-hub/</guid>
      <description>A data hub architecture is a centralized platform or infrastructure that serves as a hub for collecting, integrating, storing, and processing data from various sources within an organization. It provides a unified view of data and enables seamless data sharing and analysis across different systems and applications. In the context of manufacturing digitalization, a data hub architecture can help address several challenges:
Data Integration: Manufacturing facilities generate data from various sources, such as production equipment, sensors, supply chain systems, and quality control processes.</description>

      <title>Event Driven Architecture</title>
      <link>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/concepts/architecture/eda/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/concepts/architecture/eda/</guid>
      <description>Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern that focuses on the flow of events, notifications, and messages within a system to facilitate communication and interaction between different components or services. In EDA, systems are built to respond to events rather than following a strict procedural flow.
At the heart of is the concept of events. Events are discrete occurrences or notifications that represent changes or actions within a system. These events can include user actions, changes in data, external triggers, or any other meaningful incident.</description>

      <guid>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/reference/bpmn/events/</guid>
      <description>Events are something that happen in the course of a process. In BPMN, events are drawn with circles.
In event-driven models, events can happen in one of three dimensions:
Start. All processes begin with some trigger that starts an event. Start events are drawn with a single thin circle.
Intermediate. Possible events between the start and end. Intermediate events might start from some trigger, or create some result. They are drawn with a double thin line.</description>

      <title>Authenticate with Keycloak</title>
      <link>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/deploy/install/keycloak/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/deploy/install/keycloak/</guid>
      <description>Rhize uses OpenIDConnect to connect to a Keycloak server to authenticate users and manage Role-based access controls.
Overview of OpenIDConnect Open ID Connect is a security architecture that uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to access secured resources. JWT are issued by KeyCloak, and the users can be managed in KeyCloak, or managed in other services like LDAP, Google, Azure AD, Facebook, etc.
When a user accesses the user interface, the UI redirects to Keycloak, which depending on how it is configured, will redirect to the authentication provider so that the user can log in.</description>

      <guid>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/get-started/how-rhize-works/</guid>
      <description>This article provides a high-level overview of how Rhize works, starting with data collection and ending with user interaction. To make these concepts more concrete, the final section provides examples of each process.
The heart of the Rhize platform is its manufacturing knowledge graph, which stores data from all levels of the operation and exposes this data through a single endpoint. Around the database are services that exchange messages and process events in real-time.</description>

      <title>Activities</title>
      <link>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/reference/bpmn/activities/</link>

      <guid>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/reference/bpmn/activities/</guid>
      <description>In BPMN, an activity is work performed within a business process.
On the Rhize platform, most activities are tasks, work that cannot be broken down into smaller levels of detail. Tasks are drawn with rectangles with rounded corners. Besides tasks, you can also use call activities, processes which call and invoke other processes.
As with Gateways and events, service and call activities types are marked by their icons.
Service task templates Service tasks have a gear icon marker</description>

      <title>Gateways</title>
      <link>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/reference/bpmn/gateways/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 11:10:37 -0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/reference/bpmn/gateways/</guid>
      <description>Gateways control how sequence flows interact as they converge and diverge within a process. They represent mechanisms that either allow or disallow a passage.
BPMN notation represents gateways as diamonds with single thin lines, as is common in many diagrams with decision flows. Besides decisions, however, Rhize&amp;rsquo;s BPMN notation also includes parellel gateways.
As with Events and Activities, gateway types are marked by their icons.
Drawn as diamonds, gateways represent branches in a sequence flow.</description>

      <guid>https://MattDodsonEnglish.github.io/libremfg.github.io/pull/20/concepts/datahub/overview/</guid>
      <description>Multi-site manufacturing businesses have a data governance problem.
If they implement data governance centrally, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get the people at each site aligned and in agreement. This leads to centrally governed reports that site personnel don&amp;rsquo;t use or, worse, are inaccurate.
If they implement data governance at the site level, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to align data centrally to enable applications and analytics to be built once and deployed many times across sites.</description>

      <description>Stream data in and out of Rhize.
Publishing Changes with Change-Data-Capture You can use change data capture (CDC) to track data changes over time; including mutations and drops in your database. RHIZE&amp;rsquo;s CDC implementation lets you use Kafka, Nats or a local file as a sink to store CDC updates streamed by RHIZE&amp;rsquo;s Alpha leader nodes.
When CDC is enabled, RHIZE streams events for all set and delete mutations, except those that affect password fields; along with any drop events.</description>
