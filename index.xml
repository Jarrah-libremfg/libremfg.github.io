It unites data analysis, event monitoring, and process execution in one platform. Its interface is designed to conform to your processes. We don&amp;rsquo;t impose our opinion on what your manufacturing workflow should look like.
Rhize&amp;rsquo;s flexible, data-centric architecture can serve many functions. It has components that can completely replace your MES, historian, andon, and real-time monitoring solutions. Besides better performance and flexibility, Rhize has far tighter integration of plant and system data.</description></item><item><title>Authenticate with Keycloak</title><link>/how-to/install/keycloak/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/how-to/install/keycloak/</guid><description>Rhize uses OpenIDConnect to connect to a Keycloak server to authenticate users and manage Role-based access controls.
Overview of OpenIDConnect Open ID Connect is a security architecture that uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to access secured resources. JWT are issued by KeyCloak, and the users can be managed in KeyCloak, or managed in other services like LDAP, Google, Azure AD, Facebook, etc.
When a user accesses the user interface, the UI redirects to Keycloak, which depending on how it is configured, will redirect to the authentication provider so that the user can log in.</description></item><item><title>Overview</title><link>/concepts/overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/concepts/overview/</guid><description>Rhize is a real-time, Event-driven, Manufacturing Data Hub that has built-in Business Process Orchestration.
So what&amp;rsquo;s all that then?
Challenges For manufacturers, digitalization can bring numerous benefits, including increased productivity, improved efficiency, and enhanced decision-making capabilities. However, successful implementation must overcome many challenges:
Legacy Systems and Infrastructure: Many manufacturing facilities have outdated systems and equipment that may not be compatible with digital technologies. Integrating new digital solutions with existing infrastructure can be complex and require significant investments to upgrade or replace outdated systems.</description></item><item><title>Use the @default Directive</title><link>/how-to/query/default/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/how-to/query/default/</guid><description>The @default directive provides default values to be stored when not supplied in a mutation (add/update).
Here&amp;rsquo;s the GraphQL definition of the directives:
directive @default(add: DgraphDefault, update: DgraphDefault) on FIELD_DEFINITION input DgraphDefault { value: String } Syntax:
type Type { field: FieldType @default( add: {value: &amp;#34;value&amp;#34;} update: { value: &amp;#34;value&amp;#34;} ) } Where a value is not provided as input for a mutation, the add value will be used if the node is being created, and the update value will be used if the node exists and is being updated.</description></item><item><title>Realtime Database</title><link>/concepts/architecture/realtime-database/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/concepts/architecture/realtime-database/</guid><description>A real-time database is a type of database system that is designed to handle and process data in real-time or near real-time, meaning that data changes are immediately reflected and accessible to users or applications without any noticeable delay. These databases are commonly used in scenarios where data needs to be continuously updated and retrieved in a highly responsive manner.
Traditional databases, such as relational databases, are optimized for handling transactions and data consistency but may not be as efficient for real-time applications.</description></item><item><title>Data Hub Architecture</title><link>/concepts/architecture/data-hub/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/concepts/architecture/data-hub/</guid><description>A data hub architecture is a centralized platform or infrastructure that serves as a hub for collecting, integrating, storing, and processing data from various sources within an organization. It provides a unified view of data and enables seamless data sharing and analysis across different systems and applications. In the context of manufacturing digitalization, a data hub architecture can help address several challenges:
Data Integration: Manufacturing facilities generate data from various sources, such as production equipment, sensors, supply chain systems, and quality control processes.</description></item><item><title>Event Driven Architecture</title><link>/concepts/architecture/eda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/concepts/architecture/eda/</guid><description>Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern that focuses on the flow of events, notifications, and messages within a system to facilitate communication and interaction between different components or services. In EDA , systems are built to respond to events rather than following a strict procedural flow.
At the heart of is the concept of events. Events are discrete occurrences or notifications that represent changes or actions within a system.</description></item><item><title>Business Process Orchestration</title><link>/concepts/architecture/business-process-orchestration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/concepts/architecture/business-process-orchestration/</guid><description>Event orchestration is the coordination and management of various events, actions, and processes within a system or across multiple systems. It involves arranging and controlling the sequence of events to ensure that they occur in a logical and efficient manner, often to achieve a specific goal or outcome. Event orchestration is commonly used in various domains, including IT operations, business processes, and even in the context of cloud computing and automation.</description></item><item><title>The @generate Directive</title><link>/how-to/query/generate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/how-to/query/generate/</guid><description>The @generate directive is used to specify which GraphQL APIs are generated for a given type.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the GraphQL definition of the directive
input GenerateQueryParams { get: Boolean query: Boolean password: Boolean aggregate: Boolean } input GenerateMutationParams { add: Boolean update: Boolean delete: Boolean } directive @generate( query: GenerateQueryParams, mutation: GenerateMutationParams, subscription: Boolean) on OBJECT | INTERFACE The corresponding APIs are generated by setting the Boolean variables inside the @generate directive to true.</description></item><item><title>GraphQL Directives</title><link>/reference/directives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/reference/directives/</guid><description>The list of all directives supported by Rhize&amp;rsquo;s implementation of Dgraph.
@auth @auth allows you to define how to apply authorization rules on the queries/mutation for a type.
Reference: Auth directive
@cascade @cascade allows you to filter out certain nodes within a query.
Reference: Cascade
@custom @custom directive is used to define custom queries, mutations and fields.

Andon A system that alerts manufacturing teams about problems in processes or quality.

If they implement data governance centrally, it&amp;rsquo;s really difficult to get the people at each site aligned and in agreement. This leads to centrally governed reports that site personnel don&amp;rsquo;t use worse, are inaccurate.
If they implement data governance at the site level, it is difficult to align data centrally to enable applications and analytics to be built once and deployed many times across sites.</description></item><item><title>Stream Data</title><link>/how-to/stream/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/how-to/stream/</guid><description>Stream data in and out of Rhize.
Publishing Changes with Change-Data-Capture You can use change data capture (CDC) to track data changes over time; including mutations and drops in your database. RHIZE&amp;rsquo;s CDC implementation lets you use Kafka, Nats or a local file as a sink to store CDC updates streamed by RHIZE&amp;rsquo;s Alpha leader nodes.
When CDC is enabled, RHIZE streams events for all set and delete mutations, except those that affect password fields; along with any drop events.</description></item></channel></rss>
