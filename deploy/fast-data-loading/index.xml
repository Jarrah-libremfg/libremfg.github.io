dgraph live runs the Dgraph Live Loader dgraph bulk runs the Dgraph Bulk Loader Note Both tools only accept RDF N-Quad/Triple data or JSON in plain or gzipped format. Data in other formats must be converted. Live Loader Dgraph Live Loader (run with dgraph live) is a small helper program which reads RDF N-Quads from a gzipped file, batches them up, creates mutations (using the go client) and shoots off to Dgraph.</description></item><item><title>Bulk Loader</title><link>/deploy/fast-data-loading/bulk-loader/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 22:25:17 +1100</pubDate><guid>/deploy/fast-data-loading/bulk-loader/</guid><description>Dgraph Bulk Loader serves a similar purpose to the Dgraph Live Loader, but can only be used to load data into a new cluster. It cannot be run on an existing Dgraph cluster. Dgraph Bulk Loader is considerably faster than the Dgraph Live Loader and is the recommended way to perform the initial import of large datasets into Dgraph.
Only one or more Dgraph Zeros should be running for bulk loading.</description></item><item><title>Live Loader</title><link>/deploy/fast-data-loading/live-loader/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 22:25:17 +1100</pubDate><guid>/deploy/fast-data-loading/live-loader/</guid><description>Dgraph Live Loader (run with dgraph live) is a small helper program which reads RDF N-Quads from a gzipped file, batches them up, creates mutations (using the go client) and shoots off to Dgraph.
Dgraph Live Loader correctly handles assigning unique IDs to blank nodes across multiple files, and can optionally persist them to disk to save memory, in case the loader was re-run.
Note Dgraph Live Loader can optionally write the xid-&amp;gt;uid mapping to a directory specified using the --xidmap flag, which can reused given that live loader completed successfully in the previous run.</description></item></channel></rss>
