BPMN gateways are used to depict decision points and control flow within a process in business process modelling. Gateways enable the modelling of complex routing and branching logic, allowing for conditional paths and synchronisation of process flows. They help define how the process should behave based on certain conditions or events. The 5 gateway types, Parallel, Inclusive, Exclusive, Complex and Event Based, each represent different condition logic, such as AND, XOR, OR and +.

## Exclusive Gateway
The exclusive gateway is depicted as a diamond shaped symbol containing an ‘X' in BPMN diagrams. An exclusive gateway is a decision point in a process where only one path can be followed. It represents a point in a process where a single alternative must be chosen among multiple mutually exclusive options based on specified conditions or rules. Some common conditions are greater than or less than. When the process flow reaches an exclusive gateway, the conditions associated with each outgoing sequence flow are evaluated and the path with the first satisfied condition is selected. The process continues along that chosen path, excluding all other alternative paths. This ensures that only one path is taken based on the condition that evaluates to true. An exclusive gateway can have multiple outgoing sequence flows, enabling branching and complex decision-making within the process. Each outgoing sequence flow is associated with a condition expression, which can be based on variables, data values, or business rules. The conditions are evaluated in the order specified until a condition evaluates to true, determining the flow's direction.

## Inclusive Gateway
The inclusive gateway is depicted as a diamond shaped symbol containing a circle in BPMN diagrams. An inclusive gateway is a decision point within a business process where multiple paths can be followed. It represents a point in the process where one or more alternative options can be chosen based on specified conditions or rules. Some common conditions are greater than or less than. When a process flow reaches an inclusive gateway, the conditions associated with each outgoing sequence flow are evaluated. Unlike the exclusive gateway, multiple sequence flows can be selected if their conditions evaluate to true. This allows for parallel or concurrent paths to be followed. Inclusive gateways can have multiple outgoing sequence flows, allowing for complex decision-making and parallel execution within the process. Each outgoing sequence flow is associated with a condition expression, similar to the exclusive gateway, which determines its eligibility for selection. All sequence flows with true conditions are taken, and the process continues along each selected path.
## Parallel Gateway
The parallel gateway is depicted as a diamond shaped symbol containing a ‘+’ in BPMN diagrams. A parallel gateway is a decision point within a process that enables the parallel execution of multiple paths. It represents a point in the process where several alternative paths can be taken simultaneously, without any conditions or exclusivity between them. When a process flow reaches a parallel gateway, it splits into multiple outgoing sequence flows, each representing a separate path. Unlike exclusive or inclusive gateways, parallel gateways do not have associated conditions or rules. All outgoing sequence flows are taken simultaneously, allowing for parallel execution of activities. Parallel gateways promote efficiency and parallelism by enabling the process to distribute tasks across different systems. When all of the parallel paths have been executed and their tasks have been completed, the process flow will converge back into a single process flow at a joining parallel gateway, where the process continues following a unified path.
## Event-Based Gateway
The event-based gateway is depicted as a diamond shaped symbol containing a circle and pentagon in BPMN diagrams. An event-based gateway is a decision point within a business process that is triggered by events. It represents a point in the process where the flow can take multiple paths based on the occurrence or non-occurrence of events. It enables modelling scenarios where the process flow needs to wait for specific events such as timer events, message events, signal events, or error events, before making a decision. When a process flow reaches an event-based gateway, it waits for specific events to occur before deciding which path to take. They can have multiple outgoing sequence flows, allowing for branching and complex decision-making based on different events. When an event occurs, the gateway evaluates the conditions associated with each outgoing sequence flow. The sequence flow that corresponds to the event that occurred and satisfies its conditions is selected, and the process continues along that path.
## Complex Gateway
The complex gateway is depicted as a diamond shaped symbol containing a '*' in BPMN diagrams. Complex gateways are a type of BPMN gateway that combines multiple conditions and routing rules to determine the flow of a process. They are used to model more intricate decision-making scenarios that cannot be adequately represented using the basic gateways (exclusive, inclusive, parallel, and event-based). They provide a way to express complex business logic by evaluating multiple conditions simultaneously and determining the appropriate path based on the combination of these conditions.
