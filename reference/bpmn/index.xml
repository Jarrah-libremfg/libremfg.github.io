In BPMN, events are drawn with circles.
In event-driven models, events can happen in one of three dimensions:
Start. All processes begin with some trigger that starts an event. Start events are drawn with a single thin circle.
Intermediate. Possible events between the start and end. Intermediate events might start from some trigger, or create some result. They are drawn with a double thin line.</description></item><item><title>Activities</title><link>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/bpmn/activities/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 11:10:37 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://libremfg.github.io/reference/bpmn/activities/</guid><description>In BPMN, an activity is work performed within a business process.
On the Rhize platform, most activities are tasks, work that cannot be broken down into smaller levels of detail. Tasks are drawn with rectangles with rounded corners. Like Events, task have different types denoted by their icon marker.
Besides tasks, you can also use call activities, processes which call and invoke other processes.
